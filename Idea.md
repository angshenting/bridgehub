# Idea

## Goals

We want to make a web platform for contract bridge clubs to host their club webpages for members to see their results.

## Requirements

1. Upload and display results from USEBIO XML files
2. Upload and display hand records
3. Login using email/password or OAuth using Google
4. Ability to edit user profile
5. Connect to existing Masterpoint Database
6. Display calendar of upcoming competitions
7. Admin panel for superusers
8. Ability to post news (simple CMS)


## Scope

### In scope

1. Web-based UI
2. Basic user authentication (email/password)

### Out of scope

1. Any forms of notifications.
2. Payments and ecommerce

## Notes, considerations and constraints

We need to test the features thoroughly. Clarify requirements and details if unsure.

The deployment will be done on AWS, so we need to optimize for cost and use serverless functions where possible.
