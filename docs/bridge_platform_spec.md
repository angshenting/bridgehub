# Bridge Tournament Platform - Technical Specification

## Overview
A comprehensive bridge tournament management platform that scales from club games to international events, replacing Pianola and integrating with existing masterpoints and ratings systems.

**Key Insights from Current Bridge Software Analysis:**
- **Pianola**: Strong CMS features, membership management, partner finding, results analysis, but limited to club-level events and lacks mobile responsiveness
- **Bridgewebs**: Robust tournament features, extensive customization, hand record analysis, but outdated UI and poor mobile experience  
- **CCBA**: Handles regional/national events well but uses ASPX technology (slower performance)
- **WBF**: Manages international events but has responsiveness issues and dated interface
- **LoveBridge**: Modern tablet scoring system gaining adoption at major tournaments, showing demand for contemporary solutions

## Technology Stack Recommendation

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) or Next.js API routes (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (more robust than MySQL for complex queries)
- **Cache**: Redis (for real-time results and session management)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar (for hand records, documents)
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (for advanced tournament/player searches)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, responsive)
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Real-time**: Socket.io or WebSockets
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js for statistics

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Fly.io (backend) or AWS
- **CDN**: Cloudflare
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + analytics
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Core System Architecture

### 1. Multi-Tenant Event Management
```
├── Organizations (Clubs, Regions, Nations)
├── Events (Club games → Regional → National → International)
├── Tournaments (within events)
├── Sessions (within tournaments)
└── Results (by session/tournament/event)
```

### 2. User Hierarchy
- **Super Admin**: Platform management
- **Organization Admin**: Club/region management
- **Tournament Director**: Event management
- **Scorer**: Results entry
- **Player**: Registration, viewing results
- **Guest**: Public viewing

## Database Schema (Key Tables)

### Core Entities
```sql
-- Organizations (multi-level hierarchy)
organizations (id, name, type, parent_id, country, settings)

-- Events (can be recurring or one-off)
events (id, org_id, name, type, start_date, end_date, status, settings)

-- Players/Members
players (id, name, email, wbf_id, national_id, org_id, status, created_at)

-- Masterpoints & Ratings
masterpoints (player_id, org_id, points, level, updated_at)
ratings (player_id, rating_type, value, confidence, last_game)

-- Tournament Structure
tournaments (id, event_id, name, format, status, start_date)
sessions (id, tournament_id, session_number, date, status)
tables (id, session_id, table_number, north, south, east, west)
results (id, session_id, pair_id, position, score, masterpoints_awarded)
```

### Bridge-Specific Tables
```sql
-- Hand records and analysis
hands (id, board_number, dealer, vulnerability, pbn_data)
contracts (id, result_id, level, suit, doubled, declarer, tricks, score)
conventions (id, name, description, category)
player_conventions (player_id, convention_id, active)
```
