#### Week 12: Testing & Optimization
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Performance optimization and caching
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Load testing for concurrent users

### Bridge-Specific Technical Requirements

#### Scoring System Compatibility
- **ACBLscore integration**: Import/export capabilities for widespread ACBL software
- **BridgeMate support**: Direct integration with wireless scoring devices
- **Multiple point systems**: ACBL, EBU, WBF, and custom national systems
- **Movement generation**: Support for Mitchell, Howell, and custom movements

#### Data Standards
- **PBN format**: Full support for Portable Bridge Notation for hand records
- **LIN format**: Support for tournament record files
- **CSV/XML exports**: Compatible with existing bridge software ecosystem
- **Web standards**: Modern APIs that other bridge tools can integrate with

### Database Migration Strategy
1. **Analyze existing MySQL schema** and map to new PostgreSQL structure
2. **Create migration scripts** to transfer historical data from SCBA database
3. **Implement Pianola data import** tools for clubs transitioning from Pianola
4. **Build Bridgewebs compatibility** layer for clubs migrating from Bridgewebs
5. **Set up data validation** to ensure integrity during transfer
6. **Create rollback procedures** in case of migration issues

### Real-time Architecture
- Use WebSocket connections for live scoring updates
- Implement event-driven architecture with message queues
- Create caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Design for horizontal scaling with Redis clustering

### Security Implementation
- Implement OAuth2 with JWT tokens
- Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Create audit logging for all data changes
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data

### Mobile-First Design Principles
- Touch-friendly interface elements (minimum 44px tap targets)
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile (< 768px), tablet (768-1024px), desktop (> 1024px)
- Progressive enhancement for offline functionality
- Optimized images and lazy loading

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Backend API endpoints with pytest (Python) or Jest (Node.js)
- Frontend components with React Testing Library
- Database operations with test fixtures
- Utility functions and business logic

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end user workflows with Playwright
- API integration tests with real database
- Payment processing test scenarios
- Email delivery testing

### Performance Testing
